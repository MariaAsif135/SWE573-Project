# What is Git? 
Git is a version control system for tracking the changes made in the files. It was initially created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. It is a platform where many developers can work on a single project without having to be on the same network.Git coordinates work between multiple developers and attracts every single version and every single change that's made on the system or on the in the project. You can also revert back to specific versions of any file at any time as long as it was committed to the repository. Usually, when git is used, you'll have a repository on your local machine that you work on. you make changes and then you upload it to or you push it to a remote repository using github or bitbucket and then you can push you can push your local repository to the remote one. you don't need an internet connection to work on a repository locally and you can make changes but if you want to push it the remote repository you will need an internet connection.
